## üñ• Environment Support

## üî® Usage

The information is detailed enough, just to use the script according to the point.

But something need to notice:

- Just test with Ubuntu 20.04
- When use Port Proxy, IP that listen in Subsystem must be `0.0.0.0`
- When use Net Proxy, enable the proxy software to allow LAN connections
- The IP of Subsystem will change after Windows reboot
- The script wouldn't save any information, so you need reset after Windows reboot
